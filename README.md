**Suicide Thought Predictor**<br/>
This project is created to explore how different models perform on predicting suicide which is a worsening issue.
We attempt to achieve the optimal result by tuning hyperparameters manually or by methods such as grid search.
The optimal result is defined as having as little false negatives (Suicidal text predicted as non-suicidal text),
while not having too much false positives as it will require high manpower to sustain such a solution.
